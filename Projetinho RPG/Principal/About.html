    <i>An unspecific project about an rpg based on my personal tastes and that works only in imagination!</i>
    <br>

    <em>Basically I love fictional stories, fantastic and unimaginable in our current world. 
    Reality can be very chaotic at times so running away from it feels enchanting. Since I was little 
    I'm fascinated by stories and the immersion present in Rpgs, 
    I developed this passion and for this reason I decided to use it as a template for this page.
    I think a lot of people can relate since the Mmos are packed with players. 
    Each with their individuality and their own perspective starting a fantastic journey! It even seems like a dream.
